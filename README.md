# DH140-Final

**Initial Interest**

1. I am interested in discussing the advantages and disadvantages of early marriages. Since many of my peers are entering a marriageable age, there have been very young couples getting married, and I am curious to explore this area more. I am interested in seeing what the differences are between getting maried at an early age and at a later time in life and how that can affect your lifestyle. https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p70-167.html
2. I like this data visualization, because it shows the concentration and distribution of a certain variable across the United States. I would like to know how to create data visualizations that involve maps and quantitative data like this one.

**Possibly data sets to investiate**

1. - The quest for happiness in modern society.
   - The evolution of social interactions among humans.


2. The topic that most appealed to me is *Getting Data: Web Scraping and APIs*, because a lot of the times, the data that I work with is already given to me. However, I want to learn how to gather this data myself through web scraping. I also have heard of APIs before but have never learned about it, so this is a topic I am curious about.

**Ideas from curated datasets & project lists**
    
Dataset | Description | Link
:---: | :---: | :---:
Sources of income, and expenditures, for college athletics | The Knight Commission is tracking college athletic and academic finances to provide greater transparency. I would use this to better explain where the money comes from and where the money goes. | https://knightnewhousedata.org/
New York Philharmonic Performance History | This Performance History database documents all known concerts of all of these organizations, amounting to more than 20,000 performances. I can explore how the repertoire and orchestra composition has changed over time. | https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/
